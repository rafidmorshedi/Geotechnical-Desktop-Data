# Geotechnical-Desktop-Data
A collection of places to find data for geotechnical desktop studies. It currenly has an Australian focus, but am happy to add other areas.

Pull requests welcome.

## Geoscience/Mining data
### South Australia
* [South Australian Geomaps](http://www.minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/online_tools/free_data_delivery_and_publication_downloads/digital_maps_and_data) - maps and geology data from South Australia
* [Geoscientific Data](http://www.minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/geoscience/geoscientific_data) - includes geophysics, maps, earthquakes and remote sensing data
* [SARIG](https://map.sarig.sa.gov.au/) - South Australian Resources Information Gateway. Contains all sorts of geology/geophysics data

### New South Wales
* [Geoscience NSW](http://www.resourcesandenergy.nsw.gov.au/miners-and-explorers/geoscience-information) - a list of the various services available to miners/fossickers in NSW. Includes maps, reports, drill cores, etc. Services include DIGS, MinView, GADDS and more
* [AUSGIN](http://www.geoscience.gov.au/) - the Australian Geoscience information network. Geophysics, geology, boreholes etc
* [Burea of Meterology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/) - climate data from BOM
* [DIGS](https://search.geoscience.nsw.gov.au/) - a way to search for various reports, logs etc from the geological survey
* [MinView](https://minview.geoscience.nsw.gov.au/#/) - map of various pieces of geotechnical/geological data
* [Seamless Geology](https://www.resourcesandenergy.nsw.gov.au/miners-and-explorers/geoscience-information/projects/nsw-seamless-geology-project) - NSW seamless geology project
* [GDDAS](http://dwh.minerals.nsw.gov.au/CI/warehouse) - This provides access to spatial and non-spatial geoscientific relational data for NSW, held by Mineral Resources.
* [NSW Geoscience data packages](https://www.resourcesandenergy.nsw.gov.au/miners-and-explorers/geoscience-information/products-and-data/geoscience-data-resources/geoscience-data-packages) - Geoscience NSW data packages
* [Councils](https://www.planningportal.nsw.gov.au/lodge-track-applications/track-your-application) - many NSW councils release DA documentation for review which often includes a geotechnical report. This can be a great source of data
* [NSW Dept of Planning](https://www.planningportal.nsw.gov.au/planning-tools/open-data) - planning related spatial data sets
* [Office of Enviro and Heritage Data](http://data.environment.nsw.gov.au/dataset) - various environmental datasets

### Queensland
* [Queensland Detailed Surface Geology](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/maps-datasets/maps-data) - Can access a variety of geological, geochemical and mining data. To specifically access the latest detailed surface geology follow these steps: click "QSpatial search page" hyperlink beneath the Spatial data heading -> search "detailed surface geology - Queensland" -> download the "detailed surface geology - Queensland" polygon data set. This is usually the second search result.

### Western Australia
* [DMIRS Data and Software Centre](https://dasc.dmp.wa.gov.au/dasc/) - ets you download state-wide spatial datasets, geology series map data, resources

### Australia Wide
* [Elevation data](http://elevation.fsdf.org.au/) - DEMs and pointclouds for most of Australia
* [National Map](https://nationalmap.gov.au/) - a whole bunch of spatial datasets gathered from a wide range of sources
* [GA WMS](http://services.ga.gov.au/) - a catalogue of Geoscience Australia web mapping services
* [Geoscience Australia Data and Publications](https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/search#fast=index&from=1&to=10&hitsperpage=10) - Geoscience Australia data and publications search
* [Acid Sulfat Soil Map](http://www.asris.csiro.au/themes/AcidSulfateSoils.html) - combined ASS data sets to view and download.

### Other Parts of the world
* [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) - simply awesome
* [NASA Data](https://data.nasa.gov/) - there's too much here to unpack easily
* [LandSat data](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/where-to-get-data/) - remote sensing data
* [ESA remote sensing data](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/data-access) - there's alot here as well, but it does include SAR data for interferometry
* [NOAA data](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset) - there's an endless suppy here.

### Not quite geotechnical 
* [Other data from departments all over Australia](http://data.gov.au/dataset) - lots of administrative stuff
